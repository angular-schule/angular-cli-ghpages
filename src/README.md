# @angular-schule/ngx-deploy-starter

**Deploy your Angular app to the file system directly from the Angular CLI! 🚀**

> **Warning:**  
> This is a sample project that helps you to implement your own deployment builder (`ng deploy`) for the Angular CLI.
> The actual "deployment" is only a simple copy to another folder in the file system.

## Options

The following options are also available.


#### --configuration
 * __optional__
 * Default: `production` (string)
 * Example:
    * `ng deploy` -- Angular project is build in production mode
    * `ng deploy --configuration=qs` -- Angular project is using the configuration `qs` (this configuration must exist in the `angular.json` file)

A named build target, as specified in the `configurations` section of `angular.json`.
Each named target is accompanied by a configuration of option defaults for that target.
Same as `ng build --configuration=XXX`.
